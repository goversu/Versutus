    song15: `is it jealousy
when the crickets perform
barely a voice; a whisper in the storm
ahh
it must be sadness
when the birds all sing
melodies lost in the wind

though i wasn't made for anything special; something special was made for me
the winter's cold; only time can tell, if there's more that i could be
glowing trees; whispering, "lalalalalalala"
crystal streams; flowing like a song
i'll hide away in my forest of dreams
till i learn what happiness means

is it mystery
in the darkness beyond
look somewhere else; your hero is a fraud
ahh
it must be empty
in the champion's heart
vanity; tearing him apart

though i wasn't made for anything special; something special was made for me
the winter's cold; only time can tell, if there's more that i could be
glowing trees; whispering, "lalalalalalala"
crystal streams; flowing like a song
i'll hide away in my forest of dreams
till i learn what happiness means

a shard of hope, is all i need; to explore this forest of dreams`,
    song14: `what’s the matter?
you’re on a ladder?
it’s like everything you do you think there’s someone better
so ambitious
kinda suspicious
some dreams are meant to stay fictitious

we’re in an era where i don’t speak in tongues i speak in tungsten
i talk too much; I'm still under construction
might not believe in who i am, but trust that with a plan
tomorrow i will be a better man
yeah

i'll go majulah, the moon stars white and red
i’ll go on with you, it’s just like zubir said
i wanna keep giving back, i know who i am; i’ll never let the fame get to my head
ay

zubir said “set zeds as head"
baby you’re sad? set zeds as said
everyone else too far ahead so imma just take this path instead

and i can't prophesy it
but i wanna be zubir said
I'm keeping the silence i love when I'm quiet
oh

i’ll never be taking my phone in the loo
‘cause if we gon win we gon win in the poo
elastiggerl i’m incredible too
I don't know bout you, but baby I'm 
living my life in a digital age
winning my lane like I'm dawggy and sage
blowing them up with a combo yeah that's why they call me a mage

i'll go majulah, the moon stars white and red
i’ll go on with you, it’s just like zubir said
i wanna keep giving back, i know who i am; i’ll never let the fame get to my head

A song blew up
The numbers changed but I'm the same I'm still wonderstruck

And so i'll sing
To you who's listening
Thank you for listening

'cause it still feels like a dream to me
I'm on a quest to be the hero i wanna be
You've given me a gift i can't return i don't deserve oh
Is this what it means to be loved?

Yeah it's easy to just say thank you
And it's easy to say i'll never forget you
But maybe I'm greedy
I wanna go further since you trust in me

So i'll prove my feelings
Prove my heart
I'll work to deserve you; i'll fight so hard
And i'll prove my worth
I'll prove my love
I'll show the world
My story

People rap their lyrics but i wrap books (包书)
Know I'm bound to lose so just let me cook (讓我煮!)
Ey someday i'll be part of something awesome
But for now i don't have haters so i'll do the hating for 'em
I'll shatter your perception of a pop star
Cuz in reality 我没那么有才华
I'm just a boy who gave his dreams a shot
And i've somehow come this far

It still feels like a dream to me
I'm in a rocket and it's fueled by every stream
You've given me a gift i can't return i don't deserve oh
Is this what it means to be loved?

It's easy to just say thank you
And it's easy to say i'll never forget you
But maybe I'm greedy
I wanna go further since you trust in me

    song12: `Breathe
It'll be the same thing again

Every day is an achievement
When you can't see the end

And it's hard to fight; to understand
When it seems to last forever
Perhaps it's better just to look ahead

'cause soon i'll be
Kicking balls like major lam
Waking up with no alarm

Signing up for CDO
And trying not to RSO

I'll have a captain; A mosquito
Do days start or end with the RO?

My life is levity from monochrome

Now
I'm free, the universe beyond is mine to see
Can you feel my ORD
As my service fades to a memory
Ohh

And now i've never been to thailand but i'll show you a crescendo
Don't mean to rub it in your face but ORD o
Hey it's okay Belinda's right across the room bro
Mad? cry more weah weah go see the MO

Why they talking bout a drug free sg
The only drug I need's my favorite 3sg
It's like the road tax; erp
I love third sergeant javier kee

I'm free, the universe beyond is mine to see
Can you feel my ORD

I'm a bulldozer

'cause i'm a soldier
In 2024
But i wanna be a knight in arthur's court
Yeah
I just can't resist
I got pp in the toilet he's got pp on his wrist
Hey
[ohayo]
Can i play media pc?
Oh no… your superior wants to see me
I guess i'll just say "sorry ma'am, it'll never happen again; i promise"

Will my cq make me extend
Or is he busy being racist again
When the food is good to eat it's a
Double at the cookhouse call it obese, yeah

And as i neared the final pages
I liked tanks a lot less than mages

A minute and my Four from long is folded genius

I wonder what word could rhyme with "adventure"
My beautiful LTC's name is Quek Meng Cher
I love when he scolds me but hate weekend duties
That's fair, yeah i have to agree

So many things
I found and i felt
Taught me so much 'bout the world and myself
So what did i gain?
Were these 2 years in vain?
"i think i would do it again"`,
    song11: `Day 1
The story's just begun
Oh I'm excited for the journey soon to come
I see a lot of old friends and some new faces
My spirit blazes

I think it was a toaster
Maybe toilet paper
All I know's I'm glad I know my friends a little better
Sang a couple songs and
Had a nice devotion
Yeah it was a pretty good half a day
Ahh but still

There's so much I wanna say
Many games I wanna play
The flow of time seems different here
The hours just slip away

And I don't want the day to end
Now it seems misspent, there's so much I

Never

Had

The chance

To ask

Ah it's okay-
I'll see you tomorrow

Day 2
I woke up way too soon
I guess there's always stuff to do
Like I hid some side quests
And I played too much chess

And before long, I was wrong, they really learnt my song

(breath)

Then I turned away, still dazzled by their energy
Had to hide my tears because it really meant a lot to me
Had a couple games I was so proud of my teammates
Yeah and the night was gone again
Ahh but still

There's so much I wanna say
Many games I wanna play
The flow of time seems different here
The hours just slip away

And I don't want the day to end
Now it seems misspent, there's so much I

Never

Had

The chance

To ask

Ah it's okay-
I'll see you tomorrow

Day 3
Wait why's it start with c?
Ok the name on my nametag wasn't me
And yeah I'll skip some parts but you can trust me, my name's not audrey

Then the bombs of water
Took a little longer
Fought with one less round yeah no the dragons were just stronger
Body made of snacks
But then the night was over
And my brain gave way
Oh

There's so much I wanna say
Many games I wanna play
The flow of time seems different here
The hours just slip away

And I don't want the day to end
Now it seems misspent, there's so much I

Never

Had

The chance

To ask

Ah it's okay-

Oh there's so much I wanna do
Before I fly away
Before the weeks turn into months,
The memories start to fade
And I don't wanna leave this place
If I only know your face, there's so much I

Wasn't

Brave

Enough

To say

But it's okay
I'll see you next year`,
    song10: `What does it take to win in life
To be happy eternally
Oh, I'm blessed to know the only way
The truth that made me free

Billions of souls all gone astray
Walking blind and without a guide
Oh, So facing the world
I'll never be ashamed to believe in the gospel of Christ

Lord guide me to shine my light in the darkness around
And keep my spirit pure
I've set my eyes on a heavenly crown
One worth every trouble I'll endure
I'll be the light that this world can't ignore
Reflecting the love of my God
My every breath reminds me I'm sure
To fear and obey is my all

I've read in Your word the way gets rough
And I've found that I often fall
Oh, my every transgression breaks Your heart
But You hear my repentant prayer

You've blessed me with friends on the same strait road
I'm so grateful I'm not alone
Oh, to save us from sin, You sent Your only Son
So I can't just dishonor His blood

Lord guide me to shine my light in the darkness around
And keep my spirit pure
I've set my eyes on a heavenly crown
One worth every trouble I'll endure
I'll be the light that this world can't ignore
Reflecting the love of my God
My every breath reminds me I'm sure
To fear and obey is my all

To fear and obey is my all`,
    song9:  `On the edge of a cliff too high
Just waiting for the light to die
But it's too early to say goodbye 'cause i know i'll find a vine
I wanna make it to worlds afar
But instead I make mashita
Don't have the talent to be the best but i'm content if i'm in awe
My barn was stormed
But give me more
I'll do my teachers justice when i show them all
I'm better than
I was before; and
It's sweeter than a brownie with a caramel core
Do re mi fa so
I just lost to mipha so
Imma keep my eye on grey skies just hoping for a miracle
Fighting for a win
Where do i begin
When it feels like victory is all that i see
But suddenly-
Oh! it's nifu- it's nifu;
It feels like i'm in love for the first time
Oh! it's nifu- it's nifu;
I never knew of anything this beautiful
I guess it's fine to lose because it's just a game
Especially if you lose to lily lionmane
'cause even YaneuraOu can make mistakes so why can't i learn through the pain; i'll nifu again
See a spark in the winter air
I'll read a bit to clear my head
But i'm too lazy to say goodnight so i'll type gn instead
My favorite pokemon-
Isn't umbreon; but who am i to judge i mean i'm not the 7dan
I'll be a greenhorn
Say hi to illion
I wanna do but all these voices scream entelodont
Life's a giant blitz
Debut, show them why it's lit
Pass this dungeon over pass through time and do it like a zombie
Tell me sirius black
Am i the best of plebs
Not to say i harbour any doubts but I'm scared-
so shout with me
Oh! it's nifu- it's nifu;
It feels like i'm in love for the first time
Oh! it's nifu- it's nifu;
I never knew of anything this beautiful
I guess it's fine to lose because it's just a game
So take a deeper breath; perhaps I'll do the same
Cause even YaneuraOu will make mistakes so why can't you learn through the pain; just nifu again

Sorry collisions happen, olivandy
Ooooo

Less than Template more than Thank you for the game. Have a nice day.
Less than Template more than Could we play another game? Another game? ohhhhh`,
    song8:  `You could just call me tony stark
''Cause the truth is I'm just iron man I'm hardstuck hardstuck
But when he's beside me i can feel alive
The way he feels their angry jungler botside

So now I'm on a highway
The highway where the trucks assemble with that bus
And it's like I'm sitting in his car with his chally mmr
And I'm on my way- yamete

Onee chan-
With you it's won
You're no amumu that's me
But I'm the one that's stunned
Minna san
There's something you should know
Her blade-sama
Wa watashi no hiirou dayo

I get so lost- in his brain it's like a brilliant light show
Oh imma shout it to the stars so they will know
Her blade her blade her blade- woah
And I'm not gay but i look up to a sizeable homo
Hey it's impossible to lose unless i throw
Her blade her blade her blade her blade
It's 1v9 again

I got all these different projects
But i could never hope to ever be like ludex
And when my sister gets annoying i just think of him destroying
And i shout out his name- yamete

With you it's won
You're no amumu that's me

    song7:  `Does it ever get lonely
In the dark night sky
Don't you ever grow weary
From being the brightest light

I know it's hard to believe but
You're confined by time and space
It's the brightest of stars that are the first to lose their blaze

It's amazing how your heart's an open book
But hidden in the lines are fears and wounds
"I'm not allowed to show any emotion unless I should" mmmmm

But even if you run because you're scared
No matter what you choose, just know I'll be there
your burden will be light, like you; if it's shared

So tomorrow

May a new dawn rise
And I don't care if it's our millionth try
'Cause now we're not alone
On a journey; a modest dream to find

This path has yet to be defined
But I don't mind if it's with you; you're one of a kind
Yeah you've consumed my mind
But I'm happy being blind

"I will never be lonely"
I whispered to the sky
"Would you be happy without me?"
You asked with teary eyes

After breathing a prayer
I told you without a doubt
"While I don't know the answer,
I never wanna find out"

It's amazing how the future's in your eyes
And your voice just drives me crazy; I'm hypnotized
I think I wanna know… what it would feel like if I tried

And even if it hurts to give my best
I promise I'll return with a "daijoubu desu"
My burden will be light, like you; like a breeze; if it's shared

So tomorrow
May a new dawn rise
And I don't care if it's our millionth try
Cause now we're not alone
On a journey; our modest dream to find

This path has yet to be defined
But I don't mind if it's with you; you're one of a kind
Oh you've consumed my mind
But I'm happy being blind

We've come so far
Even if the flow of time tears it all apart
Even if someday
These memories should fade away
As long as I'm with you
As long as I'm with you
I know that I can walk to a shining future if I dare
Until my final breath

    song6:  `He doesn't like cats
He doesn't like dogs
He's really bad at numbers but he doesn't mind the odds
He doesn't like to run
He doesn't like to hide
He appreciates the pattern in a list of things he likes

When the last night hits we're nocturnal
But it's okay; owls always do it like it's normal
Fuzzy hates yeah but he loves the yeahhh
Mr. Wuzzy likes the ooooo

Here with you i don't feel so far away
Cuz home's a family so much more than it's a place
It feels like magic
To see us shining as one

I told you even legends have to close their eyes
Just take a breather maybe gaze into the crystal skies
And if you look around; this galaxy will be your stage
Reenacting every story writing out your next page

We'll pursue E.N.D.I.N.G.S; only happy ones
Spending too much time playing chess, kinda worth it tho
If you're in awe, dream on, there's nothing wrong
Out my cage i venture out of jericho's walls

Last night i had a nightmare
It starts with e4 c5 how many meh mehs
Listen very very very carefully
How many meh mehs teleported through the wall?
The answer's 5
Don't ask me why
It's not as if i knew the sheep all wanna fly
I'll say okay
I know the rule
I didn't even need to go to art school

This song exposes many lame games
And fuzzy wuzzy likes a little carpal tunnel brain
His blue watch her black hair you think i'm just dramatic but
It's actually (whatever you want) it's black magic

Strolling down the street in a bulletproof vest
Bang bang bang if you get it i'm impressed
Bullets flying everywhere; how will you decide oh
Oops i'll now inform you it was i that died

Now i just wanna say
Here with you i don't feel so far away
Cuz home's a family so much more than it's a place
It feels like magic
To see us shining as one`,
    song5:  `Some time ago i found a friend
Of course i messed it up again
"not every story has an end
At least as long as you're my friend"
Well i guess you're free- there's no need to pretend

'cause i regret the words i said but not the journey we shared
And I'd take back the pain; the hurt i caused but not what we had
And though i tried to stay afloat
You were forced to give up hope
Rest assured; you endured- now it's good

But i don't deserve forgiveness
Or the luxury of moving on
At least until i send these demons back to where they're from
Now my brain is shouting to my heart
"does failure or regret hurt more??
Please learn to not be stupid
Perhaps that's what you're broken for"

It's okay to cry but it won't fix anything; you idiot, Vers
Pull yourself together or you'll just remain a curse
And i can't pour from empty cups
But it's worse if i give up
Don't say wonderstruck if you can't even think like an adult

'cause i would be myself if doing so was harmless and fun
And i can't see the end but just a step is more than enough
Yeah this'll sound like it's a joke
But it rhymes so here we go
It's my fault, so in short; ima orrt

But i don't deserve forgiveness
Or the luxury of moving on
At least until i send these demons back to where they're from
Now my brain is shouting to my heart
"does failure or regret hurt more??
Please learn to not be stupid
Perhaps that's what you're broken for"

No i don't deserve forgiveness
Or the strength to carry on
I wish there was a reason but I can't explain at all

I don't care if I'll be lonely
I just hope that I'll be strong
I just wish there was an answer i could find before i fall `,

Hope you're feeling special cuz you're actually the worst oh (just kidding; it's the song structure)
Intelligence won't do a thing
Until practice begins bruh

If every car you feed
Is a dollar I receive
I'd be richer than the whole of Singapore's economy
If every time you miss a kill
It generates a meal
You'd have solved world hunger in a flash bro how's that feel

We're a superteam
Yeah
Oh we're the superteam mmm
We're all bout shooting stars, feeding cars, loss by time in every round
So stand with me and make a sound cuz
I mean like we're a superteam
Yeah
Oh we're the superteam mmm
We do be
Super troll super trash
Super everything that's bad
It's probably gonna stay like that
Superteam
Yeah yeah
Oh we're the superteam yeah yeahyeah
We're all bout shooting stars, feeding cars, loss by time in every round
So stand with me and make a sound cuz
I mean like we're a superteam
Yeah
Oh we're the superteam mmm
We do be
Super troll super trash
Super everything that's bad
It's probably gonna stay like that

I wish it wouldn't stay like that
Why are we so bad now
Why are we so bad at chess
Although we aren't so super
I guess we're still a team`
